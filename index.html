        It is important to give yourself the freedom to experiment with stuffs so that you can consciously choose what
        is essential to you. This is what I call Essentialism. And this is incomplete without the enthusiam to try
        and eliminate most things.

        <strong>Essentialism</strong> is not about having more, its about feeling more while having less.<br>
        <strong>Enthusiam</strong> is not about having the energy to start, its about the energy to sustain.<br />
        <strong>Experimenting</strong> is not about beginning with right , its about beginning with wrong.<br>
